These programs create a dataset of Peruvian weather data at a daily frequency.

Instructions:\
    Step 1. Retrieve raw data from SENHAMI's official webpage using the program "1.1 - Scrap SENHAMI.py", then preprocess it with "1.2 - Clean Scrapped.py" [requires Python 3] \
    Step 2. Clean raw data using the program "2 - Weather Dataset.do" [requires Stata]

Step 1's output can be downloaded [here](IN PROGRESS).
